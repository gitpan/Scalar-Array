Scalar-Array version 0.01
=========================

Scalar::Array will turn any arrayref into an iterator by simply using
the arrayref itself. Only reading is currently implemented.

SYNOPSIS

  use Scalar::Array;

  my $rr_ref = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];

  round_robin( $rr_ref );
  print sa_length( $rr_ref ); # prints 5

  print $rr_ref,"\n"; # prints 1
  print $rr_ref,"\n"; # prints 2
  print $rr_ref,"\n"; # prints 3
  print $rr_ref,"\n"; # prints 4
  print $rr_ref,"\n"; # prints 5
  print $rr_ref,"\n"; # prints 1
  print $rr_ref,"\n"; # prints 2
  print $rr_ref,"\n"; # prints 3
  ...

  my $s_ref = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];

  shrink( $s_ref );
  print sa_length( $s_ref ); # prints 5

  print $s_ref,"\n"; # prints 1
  print $s_ref,"\n"; # prints 2
  print $s_ref,"\n"; # prints 3
  print $s_ref,"\n"; # prints 4
  print $s_ref,"\n"; # prints 5
  print $s_ref,"\n"; # undef
  print $s_ref,"\n"; # undef
